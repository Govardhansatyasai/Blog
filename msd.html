                                                <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981) is an Indian professional cricketer. He is a right handed batter and a wicket-keeper. Widely regarded as one of the most prolific wicket-keeper-batsmen and captains, he represented the Indian cricket team and was the captain of the side in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Dhoni has captained the most international matches and is the most successful Indian captain. He has led India to victory in the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, the only captain to win three different limited overs tournaments. He also led the teams that won the Asia Cup in 2010, 2016 and was a member of the title winning squad in 2018.

                                                <p>The 2011 Cricket World Cup Final was the final match of the 2011 Men's Cricket World Cup, the 10th edition of ICC's championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The match was played between India and Sri Lanka at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai, India on Saturday 2 April 2011. It was the first time that two Asian teams had faced each other in an ODI World Cup final. India won the match by six wickets—its second World Cup win after the 1983 tournament—and became the third team to have won the title more than once, after Australia (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007) and the West Indies (1975 and 1979).

                                                  With these iconic words, proud and emotional, and laced with an unmistakable mixture of relief and elation, Ravi Shastri’s booming voice announced India’s ascent to the summit at the 2011 World Cup. On a muggy Saturday Mumbai night, as a wave of blue swept through the Wankhede Stadium, Mahendra Singh Dhoni applied the finishing touches to a campaign most memorable, the skipper vindicating his decision to bat ahead of the in-form Yuvraj Singh in the final against Sri Lanka with a spectacular assault, which culminated in the most storied six in Indian cricket history, over long-on off Nuwan Kulasekara.</p>
